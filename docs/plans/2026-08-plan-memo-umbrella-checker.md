# Umbrella plan — `plan-memo-umbrella-check` carved out of #506 into a 2-slice prerequisite program

**Status**: plan-review **converged** 2026-08-22 (IMP 16 → 10 → 3 across three rounds; R3's three were mechanism decisions, applied below; remaining MINs applied). Implementation order: Slice 0 → Slice 1 (this PR) → Slice 2. **Implementation record (Slice 0 `718626e9`, Slice 1 `7931798d`)**: premises of this plan the implementation found false are marked ⚠ inline below; measurements in §6 are the re-run values. Branch `vm-p4-plan-memo-checker` (worktree
`elidex-wt-vmp4checker`, base `origin/main`). Files carried verbatim from #506 @ `190d2adb` **at the
carry commit `5e9439b4`** (`git diff --quiet 5e9439b4 190d2adb -- .claude/tools/` = identical there, not

.claude/tools/plan*.py`, re-run before each push; a figure here is stale the moment a file is touched). No `crates/` change.
**Discharges** slot `#11-plan-memo-umbrella-checker-prereq` (registered 2026-08-22 in
`memory/project_open-defer-slots.md`; its "1,449 LoC" describes neither the carry (1,614) nor the program
this PR lands (3,351 at `c18d2bda`) — premise-correct the ledger to the live `wc -l` at landing) — **CLOSE −1 at landing of Slice 2**.

## §0 Why a separate program

CLAUDE.md *Edge-dense work*: a subsystem with no canonical algorithm needs plan-review **before**
implementation, is split into an umbrella + per-PR plans, and is not bundled into a feature PR.
The checker grew inside #506's converge loop without any of that: 21 commits touch `.claude/tools/`
(`git log --oneline origin/main..190d2adb -- .claude/tools/ | wc -l` = 21, re-run 2026-08-22).
Codex then spent five consecutive rounds with IMPORTANT findings in the checker — R90b 2 / R91 1 /
R92 1 / R93 2 / R94 6, each a different class of one hand-rolled Markdown + prose grammar — and in
the last three (R92–R94, `gh api` review batches 18:45Z / 18:56Z / 19:13Z) the checker was the *only*
subject: every thread under `.claude/tools/`, 0 memo threads (R91's batch also carried 2 memo threads). #506's loop cannot terminate while the tools sit in its diff.

**Why two slices, not one**: §2 names six invariants. The lexical half (I-A/B/C) has a canonical
algorithm (CommonMark 0.31.2 + GFM 0.29) and is implemented by construction; the prose half (I-D/E)
has none and is a seed with declared misses. They are reviewed against different references, so
they are different PRs. Slice 1 is what #506 needs to land (the tool, structurally sound); Slice 2
closes the three R94 threads that are predicates (#4/#5/#6).

## §1 Charter (whole program)

One gate over a plan memo and the memos it links: (a) the §5 / §8 row-kind census read from each
row's own declaring field; (b) a **seed** (declared misses, not an inventory) of prose/cell sites
that name a no-owner row (umbrella or kind-undetermined) as an owner, ordering subject, or
acceptance holder. Exit 0 = mechanical assertions clean / 1 = mechanical finding / 2 = schema miss
or unscanned population (never a clean exit for "could not scan"). Seeds never gate.

**Interim connection on `main`** (the checker's subject memo lands with #506, later): Slice 1 adds
`.claude/tools/plan-memo-umbrella-selftest-trip-wire.sh` (runs `python3 … --self-test --mutants`;
memo-independent — fixtures live in `tempfile` dirs, 0.08 s) **and registers it in `REQUIRED_WIRES`
in `scripts/trip-wires.sh` in the same commit** — the driver diffs the glob against that list in both
directions and FAILs an unregistered wire (list `scripts/trip-wires.sh:85-90`, diff + FAIL
`:208-235`; measured: a stub wire → rc 1 "ran but are not registered"). Two documentation claims become false and are updated in the
same commit: `.github/workflows/ci.yml:152` "No toolchain step: the wires are grep-only" (this wire
needs `python3`, present on `ubuntu-latest` but named nowhere in the workflow — state the dependency
there) and the wire inventory comment in `mise.toml:103-106`. A CLAUDE.md *Development Rules*
sentence names the tool + its trip-wire. The memo-specific invocation clause stays in #506. **#506's
concurrent-branch obligations at its `git merge origin/main`** (both branches touch the same paths;
neither is resolved by the merge driver): (a) the three pre-split tool files #506 carries
(`plan-memo-umbrella-check.py` / `plan_memo_tables.py` / `plan_memo_umbrella_selftest.py`, last touched
there at `190d2adb`) conflict modify/modify against this PR's rewrite of the same names — #506 must
**DROP its side** (`git checkout --theirs`, i.e. take `main`'s) rather than resolve hunk by hunk, since
its versions are the pre-Slice-0 monolith this program replaces; (b) `CLAUDE.md:54` is duplicated: #506's
"Plan-memo checker" bullet must **shrink to the memo-specific invocation clause only** (which memo, when to
run it, what its exit means for that memo) — this PR's bullet carries the tool description, exit codes and
the trip-wire — and must **reword** its "だから `trip-wires` には入れない" sentence (true of the memo run,
false of the self-test wire once this lands). The file header's "branch `vm-p4-plan-doc`" / "home is
CLAUDE.md" / "duplicated four ways" lines and the two `§6.6` docstrings (`plan_memo_tables.py:116/153`,
CommonMark 0.31.2 §6.6 = Raw HTML) are rewritten in Slice 1.

## §2 Coupled invariants (edge-dense)

- **I-A Lexical masking** — text inside fenced blocks and inline code spans is never read as a
  link, as prose, **or as a kind marker** (today `umbrella_ids` / `_attributed_to_other` read the
  declaring field raw, so a *quoted* `` `UMBRELLA, not a terminal unit` `` contaminates the census —
  probe: fixture row 7z quoting the phrase joins `umbrella_ids()`); code spans are lexed over the
  **block's inline content** (paragraph / cell), never per line — CommonMark §6.1 spans may contain
  line endings, and per-line pairing flips parity on every line a span crosses (measured at
  `190d2adb` with `awk '{n=gsub(/\`/,"\`"); if(n%2==1)print FILENAME":"NR}'` over the four memos,
  fence lines excluded: **10** prose line-pairs in the main memo + 2 in `umbrella-review-rounds.md`;
  `--worklist` at review-rounds 276–277 lists 7 mentions of which **4** sit inside one span
  (276: 0b/0c/1a, 277: 1b) and are artefacts, while review-rounds:115 `"Slice 4"` is masked today by
  a per-line pairing and becomes a real mention — net delta of the 706 under block lexing was
  predicted **−3**; ⚠ measured **−4**: this plan missed a second multi-line span at review-rounds:114
  (`` `Deps: 1b (I-3\nhelper)` ``) whose `1b` is now masked); a line is a reporting coordinate only. A **paragraph** ends at a blank line,
  a fence, a table row, an ATX heading, a list-item start or a `>` line (⚠ each `>` line starts a
  new paragraph — stricter than CommonMark lazy continuation; no memo has a multi-line blockquote;
  CommonMark: a span never crosses a block boundary; control = backtick opened in one list item and closed in the next ⇒
  literal). When a `|` inside backticks splits a row, each half holds an unmatched backtick string
  (§6.1 ⇒ literal) and is scanned as prose — control: umbrella id on each side ⇒ 2 mentions. **Disposition exception**: a code span whose content is only row ids (and
  separators) is the document *spelling* an id and IS a mention (existing `code_spans(keep=…)`,
  POSITIVE control). So masking is not id-independent — see order below.
- **I-B Link grammar** — every CommonMark §6.3 link form (inline: plain / `<dest>` / fragment /
  title / balanced parens; reference: full / collapsed / shortcut with §6.3 label matching =
  casefold + strip + collapse internal whitespace; definitions per §4.7 incl. `<dest>`) yields its
  destination; the `.md` file part of each destination, **transitively** over linked memos, is the
  sibling population; duplicate definitions: **the first in the document wins** (§6.3; today a dict
  comprehension makes the last win). An absent target = exit 2. Link **text** is scanned as prose
  (B×D, a stated deviation); ⚠ a reference *definition* line renders nothing and is masked whole,
  label included. ⚠ The `#11-` slot-id pass reads through code spans (a backticked slug is the
  document spelling an id — the same disposition exception as I-A); fences and link tails mask it.
- **I-C Table admission (local policy over GFM §4.10)** — GFM: header and delimiter row must have
  equal cell counts (else no table); body rows "may vary" (short padded, long truncated); leading
  pipe optional. **This checker overrides the "may vary" clause**: a body row whose cell count ≠
  header is a schema miss (exit 2), never a silent skip or a shifted read — because a shifted read
  fabricated a mechanical finding in a probe (long row → spurious `UMBRELLA-MARK`). Admission is
  decided **once** in `find_tables`; every per-consumer width guard is deleted — **nine** today
  (`grep -n 'len(cells)' .claude/tools/*.py` at `190d2adb`: `tables.py:334/374/400`,
  `check.py:333/460/496/533/586/617`; `tables.py:54 is_separator` is structural and stays), and the
  acceptance is that grep returning only `is_separator`, not this list (8 are skips, `check.py:333`
  is a ternary degrade to `None` — same class). **Cell shape**: `find_tables` is the single writer
  of a row's cells and emits **body cells** (optional leading/trailing pipes stripped at admission,
  per GFM); `SCHEMAS` column indexes are re-based to body columns, `scan_tables` offsets are computed
  from each body cell's raw start — no reader re-splits the line (today every reader indexes the
  raw split incl. the leading empty cell, so an admitted pipe-less row would shift every read by
  one: the I-C class again). Control: the same table written without leading/trailing pipes yields
  the same ids and the same reported spans. The row lexer applies to **every** GFM row (≈154–158
  non-schema `|` rows exist today; `grep -c '^|'` minus schema rows): non-schema tables enter the
  `Population` with `schema=None` (cells lexed, no `self_id`, no width policy — the exit-2 width rule
  is for schema tables only, whose cells the checker reads).
- **I-D Naming population = complement** — an id mention is reported unless attached to a licensed
  construction; a licensed prefix does not license a later clause of the same sentence; a row's
  mention of itself is classified like any other (the existing NEGATIVE control "a row naming itself
  in its own cell" **flips to POSITIVE** when the role is forbidden; the licensed `mints its
  children` form stays NEGATIVE).
- **I-E Kind attribution (a closed grammar of predication — mechanical, not a seed)** — a kind
  marker in a row's declaring field is *self-declaring* **unless** it is the predicate of a clause
  whose subject is another row's id, and a clause is recognised only by a **predication connective**
  between that subject and the marker: ` — ` (appositive dash), ` is ` (copula), `, which is `
  (relative). Binding: the subject is the **nearest preceding `row-noun + id` with nothing but
  emphasis marks between the id and the connective** (`Slice **9z** (child of Slice **7z**), which
  is …` ⇒ no binding ⇒ self-declaring; control). No connective ⇒ self-declaring: `Unlike Slice 7z,
  **UMBRELLA…**` (existing NEGATIVE control; a proximity rule fails it — measured, and
  `tables.py:351-358` records the same failure once before). The connective set is the **whole**
  accepted grammar — closed, each member a control — because the attribution result gates today
  (`check.py:440-444` appends `UMBRELLA-MARK` ⇒ rc 1) and therefore cannot be a §1 seed: a false
  attribution is a false rc 1, a missed one lets a pointer row into the census where assertion (b)
  can fire. Controls therefore include the title-shaped false-attribution NEGATIVE (`**Slice 9 —
  UMBRELLA…**` where `Slice 9` is a *title*, not a row id … verified against the 48 real declaring
  fields: all are `**<title> — UMBRELLA…**` with no row-noun+id, 0 attributions under both the old
  and the new rule). ` was ` is not a connective (no motivating instance in the population;
  `Slice 9z was **UMBRELLA…** until R3` in 9z's own field must stay self-declaring — NEGATIVE control).
  ⚠ **Slice-1 delta in I-E territory** (`/code-review high` F4, `2ff35065`, kept): `attributed_to_other`
  now reads the **first** marker occurrence in the field and that occurrence alone decides — a field that
  declares itself and then says a sibling "is not it" is self-declaring, and a later occurrence never
  overrides the first ("first marker occurrence decides; self-declaring ⇒ None"). Slice 2's connective
  grammar is written over that rule, not over "any occurrence".
- **I-F One pipeline, one population** — `check(memo)` is the only entry (⚠ implemented as a `Result` NamedTuple whose first three fields are `findings, notes, rc` — the report also needs `mentions` and `population`);
  `main()` and `--self-test` both call it. A single transitive `Population` (tables, row ids, census)
  is built once and is the only input of the mention scan, the code-span keep-set (`all_ids`,
  `check.py:658` today main-only) and the four assertions (`memo.data_rows`, `check.py:459-616` today
  main-only) — probe: a sibling-declared terminal id in an id-only run masks the umbrella next to it,
  and a sibling umbrella with a `Deps` edge is never asserted. Sharing the pipeline gives the
  gating stages reachability, not proof, so §6 binds a control to each of them explicitly. Mutation
  proof is **re-executable**: a `MUTANTS` table (name → exact source substring → replacement →
  control expected red); `--self-test --mutants` loads the module from the patched source text via
  `importlib` (`spec_from_loader` + `exec_module` on a string), a substring that no longer applies is
  a **FAIL** (never "survived"). Mechanics for the three-module layout after Slice 0: a mutant names
  its module; the patched module is exec'd from the patched source and installed in `sys.modules`
  under its import name **before** the checker module is loaded; every mutant gets a fresh module
  set; the substring must occur **exactly once** (`count == 1`, else FAIL — `len(cells)` occurs 10×
  today). The trip-wire runs both `--self-test` and `--mutants`. **Duplicate declarations**: the
  transitive `Population` is a map `id → (kind, declaring memo)`; the same id declared in two memos is
  a schema miss (exit 2 — "could not scan" is never clean); link cycles (A→B→A) are walked with a
  visited set and are not an error. Controls for both.

**Lexing order (settles A×B, A×C, A×D, A×E)**: document → fenced blocks masked (CommonMark §4.5) →
blocks: a GFM row is split on *raw* unescaped `|` (GFM §4.10 prose: escaping works "including
inside other inline spans"; that an *unescaped* `|` inside backticks splits is inferred from
Example 200, `` `\|` `` → `<code>|</code>`; `\|` becomes `|` in cell content) → per block inline
content (paragraph or cell): code spans (CommonMark §6.1, backtick strings of equal length) → links
(CommonMark §6.3 / §4.7) → **row ids read from the raw id cell** (15 of the 48 census ids are
backticked `#11-` slugs; `bare_id` strips them itself, so ids never depend on the mask — no cycle) →
code-span disposition (id-only run ⇒ mention) → kind markers read from the masked declaring field →
scanners read that stream.

Intersections: A×B = links come only from the masked stream (R94 #2); A×C = cell split precedes
masking (GFM order; a masked stream fed to the splitter would break I-C); A×D = id-only spans are
mentions, so disposition needs ids, so tables precede disposition; B×C = a sibling's tables join
the **census** and the scan (today the census is main-only: `no_owner_ids` at `check.py:709`,
probe: umbrella declared in a sibling is invisible) — Slice 1's `Population` is transitive and is
the single input of census, keep-set and assertions (I-F); A×E = the kind-marker reader reads the
masked declaring field (a quoted marker is not a declaration); B×D = link labels are prose; C×D = a row of wrong width has no cells to scan ⇒ exit 2; D×E = a pointer
row's attribution text is a licensed mention of the attributed id; D×F / E×F = each licensing arm
and each attribution spelling has a positive control and a mutant.

**Out of the lexing bound (not lexed, and — honestly — not detected)**: CommonMark §4.4 indented
code, §4.6 HTML blocks, §5 container blocks, §6.5 autolinks, §2.5 entity references (§6.4 images
ARE lexed — their bracket structure, see the PR #510 rows). Text in those constructs is read
*as written*: a non-`|` line as prose, a `|` line as a row (so a `|` row inside an HTML comment is
admitted, and a `> |` row is not a row). Population today: 0 such rows. No `[LEX-UNSUPPORTED]`
detector is claimed; the bound is the listed rows, nothing more.

**Breadth**: K=2 (CommonMark 0.31.2, GFM 0.29), M=9
**Split decision**: by the edge-dense rule (not K/M): umbrella + **2 slices** (§7). Each slice is a
terminal unit under this umbrella. The memo split `#11-vm-p4-memo-section-seam-split` is a separate
follow-up, not needed here; its ledger note (paraphrase: the checker must first include sibling
tables in the census) is **satisfied by Slice 1 (B×C)** — premise-correct the ledger at landing.

### §3.1 User-input touch audit

No opcode / native / ECS surface. Input = repository Markdown. Data-flow model in lieu of an ECS map:
SoT = memo text; derived, in order = fences → rows → cells → code spans → links → ids → mask
disposition → mentions → census → findings.

## §4 Open defects (Codex R94 on #506, threads left open there as inventory) → slice

| # | Site @ `190d2adb` | Defect | Invariant | Slice | Closed by |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `plan_memo_tables.py:163-188` | label match lacks **internal-whitespace collapse** (case already lowered both sides — `lower()`, not casefold) | I-B | 1 | grammar |
| 2 | `plan_memo_tables.py:166` | `links()` reads raw text; a link in a code span / fence is taken as real ⇒ exit 2 on a valid memo | I-A×B | 1 | lexing order |
| 3 | `plan_memo_tables.py:87` | body-row width not validated at admission; 8 consumer guards skip silently + 1 degrades (`check.py:333`); long row fabricates a finding | I-C | 1 | single admission site |
| 4 | `plan-memo-umbrella-check.py:180` | licensed-kind prefix licenses a forbidden later clause | I-D | 2 | predicate |
| 5 | `plan-memo-umbrella-check.py:269` | `self_id` exclusion hides a forbidden self-attached role | I-D | 2 | predicate (+ control flip) |
| 6 | `plan_memo_tables.py:364` | attribution recognises only the dash-appositive | I-E | 2 | structural subject rule |

Also Slice 1 (found by plan-review R1, no Codex thread): census is main-memo-only (B×C);
sibling discovery is one level deep (I-B transitive); harness ≠ `main()` on three gating stages
(I-F); `_REF_DEF` / destination / title character classes (§3).

## §5 Design decision — subset lexer (Option A), with its fidelity bound stated

Option B (a Markdown library) would give full CommonMark fidelity, but `.claude/tools/` has no
Python dependency mechanism (stdlib only; no manifest in the repo — `git ls-files | grep -E
'requirements|pyproject|Pipfile'` = 0), the stdlib has no Markdown parser, and the checker needs two
deliberate deviations a parser's AST would have to be post-processed for anyway (id-only code spans
are mentions; link labels are scanned). Introducing a dependency mechanism for one tool is a
separate infra decision — **deferred trigger-only, no slot**: re-evaluate if a second Python tool
in `.claude/tools/` needs a parser, or if a §3 row proves un-implementable as a clause. Therefore
**A**: the constructs in §3 are lexed by construction from the spec clauses listed there, each clause
with a control; constructs outside §3 are read as prose and are listed there as not detected. The
`feedback_helper-prefer-upstream-machine-readable` memory concerns spec *data* sources and is not a
ground for either option; it is not cited.

## §6 Acceptance (per slice)

- **Slice 1**: `--self-test` and `--self-test --mutants` green; a positive control + named mutant
  for: every §3 ✗ row, §4 #1–#3, **each exit-gating stage** (absent sibling → rc 2, missing schema →
  rc 2, KIND-SPELLING → rc 1, sibling-declared umbrella in the census, sibling row in the keep-set,
  sibling `Deps` edge asserted), multi-line code span, quoted kind marker (A×E), `\|` unescape
  (⚠ the link-cycle control has no mutant — removing the visited set hangs; control only);
  `check()` is the only pipeline and `grep -n 'len(cells)'` returns only `is_separator`; the #506
  memo at its head re-run reports census `48 = 33 + 15`, rc 0, and the site count is **re-measured
  and reported with its delta** (706 at `190d2adb` → **702**, −4, re-run 2026-08-22 on `7931798d`;
  ⚠ **703** after the `/simplify` pass made the scanners block-level like the lexer -- the one new
  site is main-memo 2604 `2`, whose row noun `rows` ends line 2603, i.e. a line is a reporting
  coordinate only; **703 again, the same 703 sites** (`--worklist` file/line/id/source set
  identical) after the `/code-review high` pass, re-run 2026-08-23: **140 controls, 67 mutants / 0
  survived / 0 crashed** -- a crashing control is now a FAIL, not a kill -- census `48 = 33 + 15`,
  rc 0, 36 ORDER-PROSE? rows unchanged, memo run 0.39 s → 0.28 s. ⚠ That pass changed one
  `Population.ids` key without moving the census: the §8 `Intl` row (main memo line 2716, id cell
  `` `Intl` → owned externally by … ``) was keyed by its WHOLE cell, because `bare_id` fell back
  to the cell text when no grammar matched; the id cell now reads the one decorated-id grammar at
  the cell's start and that row is keyed `Intl` (a 4-character id, terminal). A non-empty id cell
  that does not start with an id declares nothing and was reported as an `[ID-CELL]` note (⚠ since the
  Stage-6 pass below: a schema miss, rc 2 — an unkeyed row's cells go unasserted, the I-C class); the
  main memo has 0 such rows (`**—**` is an empty cell). `mise run trip-wires` rc 0);
  trip-wire added, registered, green in `mise run trip-wires`; header + docstrings rewritten.
  ⚠ **`/elidex-review` Stage-6 pass (re-run 2026-08-23)**: **162 controls, 80 mutants / 0 survived / 0
  crashed**, census `48 = 33 + 15`, rc 0, **36 ORDER-PROSE? rows unchanged (same rows)**, sites
  **703 → 717** (+14, nothing lost): both sides of the bare-id boundary are now the complement of the
  id-continuation class (`[0-9A-Za-z]`, a `.` inside a dotted number; a decorated side bounded by its
  decoration; a hyphen BOUNDS a short id on both sides — only the `#11-` slug keeps internal hyphens,
  and `slice-9z-sib.md` is safe as a lexer `file` token). Gained: ten ids bounded by an ASCII `"` the
  old punctuation list did not name (main:1944/2007×2/3004/3009/3049, detail:201×2/215/267 — all
  quotations of withdrawn ordering / owner text, reported by default); `` `9d` `` at main:1081, the far
  end of `` `9a`-`9d` `` whose decoration now bounds it; and three ids the old asymmetric rule (rhs `-`
  admitted, lhs `-` not) hid behind a leading hyphen — main:1978 `9c` in `9a-9c`, main:1983 `1b` in the
  second `"1b-5"`, main:3053 `1a` in `0cb-before-1a`. Unresolved references and unkeyed
  schema rows became schema misses (rc 2) — the memo has 0 of either, so rc stays 0. Every seed and
  the licensing rule read the block's one disposed stream (`stream()`), so a `gates` or `MERGED`
  inside a code span is code; measured: no ORDER-PROSE? row moved. `is_empty` is decided by shape
  (no alphanumeric) with `n/a` / `none` as the only lexical exceptions — for `Deps`; the ID cell's
  blanks are LITERAL (`""` / `—` / `-` / `–` after decoration strip, `is_blank_id_cell`), so a `?` / `…`
  id cell is unkeyed → rc 2, not a silent non-row. A citation-grammar label (`[C19]`) is exempt from
  the unresolved-reference miss in every form (shortcut / full `[C19][C20]` / collapsed `[C19][]`).
  Stage 4.5 re-run: **168 controls, 83 mutants / 0 / 0**, 717 sites unchanged. Slice-1 delta recorded under
  I-E above. `mise run trip-wires` rc 0.
- **Slice 2**: §4 #4–#6 each with positive + mutant controls, I-E's connective set each a control
  plus the `Unlike Slice 7z` negative; the flipped self-reference control documented; R94 threads
  #4/#5/#6 resolved on #506; slot CLOSE −1.

## §7 Slices

- **Slice 0 — touch-time split (standalone prereq commit, stacked first)**: `plan-memo-umbrella-check.py`
  (811) has seams at the licensing-rule regex block (L139–209) / mentions+scan (L210–361) / roles
  (L362–395) / assertions (L396–641) / pipeline `collect_mentions` (L642–687) / `main` (L688–). Slice 1
  touches the assertions (guard deletion) and the pipeline, Slice 2 touches roles and `_anchored`;
  both slices touch both `.py` files. Per `feedback_split-on-touch-prereq-workflow` the split precedes
  the first touching edit: roles + assertions → `plan_memo_roles.py`, behaviour-preserving, self-test
  green. ⚠ The licensing regex block (L139–209) moved with them — the assertions import it and
  leaving it behind is an import cycle; ⚠ the fixture builder lives with the cases, not the runner
  (a top-level `from selftest import build` in the cases module is a cycle); the runner imports it. The self-test (396) receives the most new text in Slice 1 (≥20 controls + the MUTANTS
  table), so it is split in Slice 0 too: `plan_memo_umbrella_selftest.py` (runner + fixture builder)
  / `plan_memo_selftest_cases.py` (CASES / ASSERT_CASES) / `plan_memo_selftest_mutants.py` (MUTANTS,
  Slice 1 creates it).
- **Slice 1 — lexical substrate + one pipeline + one population** (I-A/B/C/F; §3 all rows; §4
  #1–#3; interim connection; header/docstring rewrite). Touch set: `plan_memo_tables.py` (lexer,
  `split_row`, `find_tables`, `links`, `code_spans`, `Memo`), `plan-memo-umbrella-check.py` (`check()`,
  keep-set, guard deletion), `plan_memo_roles.py` (guard deletion only), selftest, the trip-wire,
  `scripts/trip-wires.sh`, `ci.yml` comment, `mise.toml` comment, CLAUDE.md sentence. Plan-review on a
  per-PR plan before implementation; lands first.
- **Slice 2 — prose predicates** (I-D/E; §4 #4–#6). Touch set: `plan_memo_roles.py` (licensing,
  connective grammar), `plan-memo-umbrella-check.py::_anchored` (self_id), `plan_memo_tables.py::
  _attributed_to_other` (moves to roles), selftest. Plan-review; lands second.

## §8 Defer (owned here, not only in file headers)

- Acceptance half of assertion (b) — "not implementable here"; slot
  `#11-plan-memo-acceptance-falsifiability-check` is minted in #506's memo (§5 mention `190d2adb:…:1218`, §8 row `:2711`)
  and is **not yet in the slot SoT ledger** (`memory/project_open-defer-slots.md` = 0 hits); its
  ledger registration is owed at #506's landing, not here. No date — trigger = #506 landing.
- The four assertions' owner, `#11-plan-memo-spec-field-single-home-check` (cited by the tool headers
  as "the single-home slot #506's memo §8 mints") — the same pre-agreed commitment: minted in #506's
  memo §8 (`190d2adb:…:2710`), **not in the slot SoT ledger** (0 hits), registration owed at #506's
  landing, not here; the headers cite that origin rather than presenting the slot as registered.
- Two KNOWN-MISS bare-id shapes (numeric / single letter) — declared in the self-test; trigger = a
  memo minting such an id; no slot (seed boundary, not a platform gap); no date — trigger-only.
- GFM row splitter duplicated four ways across three branch families — trigger = two of
  them on `main`; Slice 1's `split_row` is the candidate canonical copy; no slot; no date — trigger-only.
- Markdown library dependency (§5) — trigger-only (see §5); no slot; no date.
