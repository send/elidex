//! Slot #10.6c: `RegisterRenderer` ack-handshake helper.
//!
//! Extracted from `broker/handle.rs` in slot #10.6c Copilot R2
//! HX5 once the new helper + its tests pushed the parent file
//! past the project's ~1000-line file-split threshold (the same
//! convention applied earlier in slot #10.5 to
//! `vm/gc/mod.rs:16-28` and `vm/host/headers/mod.rs:67-82`).
//!
//! Defines:
//! - [`REGISTER_ACK_TIMEOUT`] — 500 ms upper bound on the
//!   `RegisterRenderer` ack wait.  See the doc comment for the
//!   trade-off rationale.
//! - [`register_with_ack`] / [`register_with_ack_for_test`] —
//!   the ack-handshake itself, plus a timeout-parameterised
//!   variant for unit tests.
//!
//! Production callers ([`super::handle::NetworkProcessHandle::create_renderer_handle`]
//! / [`super::handle::NetworkHandle::create_sibling_handle`])
//! flow through `register_with_ack`; only the unit tests in the
//! local `tests` submodule reach for `register_with_ack_for_test`.

/// sub-millisecond (one broker iteration —
/// `sel.ready_timeout(1s)` wakes immediately on the new control
/// message — plus the ack send), and even a heavily-loaded
/// broker drains control before request and inserts into
/// `clients` in tens of microseconds.  Anything past 500 ms is
/// pathology (broker thread starved, hung in a long lock, or
/// blocked on a slow `cleanup_finished` poll), at which point
/// we'd rather fast-fail to a pre-unregistered handle than
/// freeze the caller for several seconds.
///
/// The shorter ceiling matters because
/// [`super::handle::NetworkProcessHandle::create_renderer_handle`]
/// / [`super::handle::NetworkHandle::create_sibling_handle`]
/// are called directly from browser-thread paths (e.g.
/// `App::open_new_tab`, `sw_coordinator::register`) and the
/// `new Worker()` constructor in the JS host — none of those
/// tolerate a multi-second freeze of the event loop on a
/// stalled broker (Copilot R1).  An R1-era 5 s ceiling would
/// have been a UX regression on the very paths that drove the
/// original race fix.
///
/// On timeout the caller receives a pre-unregistered
/// `NetworkHandle` so every subsequent operation surfaces the
/// slot #10.6b synthetic error path immediately rather than
/// queueing into a broker that has no `clients` entry for us.
/// The timeout branch ALSO sends a follow-up
/// [`NetworkProcessControl::UnregisterRenderer`] so a broker
/// that resumes draining later cleans up the stale entry
/// itself (FIFO on `control_tx` guarantees the orphan-
/// preventing pair is processed in order — Copilot R1 F1).
