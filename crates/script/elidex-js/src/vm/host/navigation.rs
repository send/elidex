//! Navigation state — `Location` / `History` / `document.URL` / reload.
//!
//! # Single session-history source of truth = the shell
//!
//! A `Vm` is bound to one document and does not own the network/render
//! pipeline, so it **cannot** navigate itself — navigation replaces the whole
//! pipeline, which the shell owns. The session history of record is therefore
//! the shell's `NavigationController`; the VM keeps only a **current-document
//! view** ([`NavigationState`]) plus the **pending intent** buffers the shell
//! drains after a script turn (S1c boa→VM cutover, the back-channel slice).
//!
//! - `location.assign`/`href=`/`replace`/`reload` and `history.back`/`forward`/
//!   `go` are *enqueue-only* (WHATWG HTML §7.4.2.2 "Beginning navigation" /
//!   §7.4.6 "Applying the history step" — async loads the shell performs): they
//!   set [`NavigationState::pending_navigation`] / `pending_history` and do NOT
//!   mutate `current_url` (it commits when the shell calls `set_current_url`
//!   after the load — so `location.href = "/x"; location.href` reads the OLD URL,
//!   matching browsers).
//! - `history.pushState`/`replaceState` (HTML §7.2.5 "shared history push/replace
//!   state steps" → the "URL and history update steps" (§7.4.4)) are *synchronous*: the
//!   VM updates `current_url` + `current_state` in place (and `pushState` also
//!   bumps `history_length`) AND enqueues a `HistoryAction::PushState/ReplaceState`
//!   for the shell to persist.  Each one independently mutates the joint session
//!   history, so the enqueue buffer is a **FIFO queue** (two same-turn pushStates
//!   must both reach the shell), unlike the last-wins async `pending_navigation`.
//! - `history.length` / `history.state` read `history_length` (shell-pushed, plus
//!   the synchronous `pushState` bump the shell reconciles) / `current_state` (set
//!   by `pushState`/`replaceState`; a traversal leaves it untouched — async, the
//!   shell restores the target entry's state on commit).
